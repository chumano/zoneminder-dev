## ZoneMinder BuildSystem Dockerfiles

ZoneMinder's automated build system uses the [PackPack](https://github.com/packpack/packpack) project to generate ZoneMinder packages for various redhat & debian distros. A Docker container must exist for each ZoneMinder package generated by the build system. If a particular Docker container does not already exist as part of the packapck project, they are added here and then uploaded independantly to dockerhub.

The Docker files shown here are not intended to run ZoneMinder directly, and consequently they will not be useful to the average end user. However, advanced users looking to expand the build system to support a new distro can use the Dockerfiles shown here as an example to start from.
